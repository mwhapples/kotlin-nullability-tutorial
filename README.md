# Tutorial for Nullability Features of Kotlin

This repository contains a number of examples to help demonstrate the nullability features of kotlin and ways to deal with a number of situations. You will find the original problem on the main branch and solutions on the solutions branch.

The examples have been separated into their own module within the gradle project. Each example has tests and also are runnable applications. The tests are more extensive than the runnable application and should be considered as what needs to pass for a solution to be valid. The runnable application gives a simple example of how the code should be run.

You probably only want to run an individual example at a given time, so use the module features of gradle to achieve this. As an example you could run the tests for example 1 with the command `gradlew :example1:test`.
